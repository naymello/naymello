### Hello, world!

Ever since I was a kid I'm really into technology, solving logic/math problems, helping people around me and learning new stuff all the time. I guess there was no escape. Besides that, my interest goes from watching all the football matches I can to reading philosophy books and listening to all the music the '70s have to offer.

I'm currently learning **TypeScript**, **React Native** and plenty of soft skills, aside from languages such as italian and german. Check my [portfolio](https://naymello.github.io/) or [text me](mailto:naymellodev@gmail.com) to know more.
