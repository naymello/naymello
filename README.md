### Hello world, my name is Nay Mello üë©‚Äçüíª

Ever since I was a little child, I really liked technology, solving logic/math problems, helping people around me and learning new stuff all the time. I guess there was no escape. Besides that, my interest goes from watching all the football matches I can to reading philosophy books and listening to all the music the '70s has to offer.

I'm currently learning TypeScript, NextJS and plenty of soft skills. Check my [portfolio](https://naymello.github.io/) or [text me](mailto:naymellodev@gmail.com) to know more.
